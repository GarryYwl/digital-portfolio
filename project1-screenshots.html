    <br><h1>Resume Automation Project (SCCCI)</h1><br>

    <p>This full-stack web application was developed for the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce & Industry (SCCCI) to streamline and automate their resume screening process.</p><br>

    <p>The system includes features such as user registration, login authentication, password recovery, and user profile management. The frontend was built using React.js while the backend was developed with Node.js and MongoDB for database handling.</p><br>

    <p>My contributions focused on the UI/UX design and front-end development. I designed the user interface with a focus on clarity and responsiveness, implemented key user pages like registration and login, and developed the profile management system which allows users to update and maintain their personal information. I also worked closely with my teammates to ensure seamless integration between the frontend and backend components.</p><br>
