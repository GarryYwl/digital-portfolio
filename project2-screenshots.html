    <br><h1>Flask Web Application</h1><br>

    <p>This web application was developed during the App Development module as a prototype solution to reduce textile waste. The system was designed to allow users to manage their clothing profiles, promoting reuse and reducing unnecessary purchases.</p><br>

    <p>The application was built using Python Flask for the backend and HTML for the frontend interface. It includes full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for user profiles, with a clean and intuitive user interface.</p><br>

    <p>My key responsibilities included designing the profile management system and implementing user actions such as updating and deleting profile information. I also played a role in ensuring that the user interface was simple and accessible, contributing to a smoother user experience overall.</p>
