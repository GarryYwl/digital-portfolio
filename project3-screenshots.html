    <br><h1>Web Application about Historical Revolutions</h1><br>

    <p>This educational web application was developed to teach users about three of the most significant historical revolutions: Agricultural, Industrial, and Digital Revolutions. The goal was to make history more engaging and interactive for students through a digital platform.</p><br>

    <p>The application was built entirely by me using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on clean layout, responsiveness, and ease of use. It features historical timelines, summaries of each revolution, and interactive quizzes to test users' knowledge.</p><br>

    <p>I was responsible for the full development process, including front-end interface design, content structuring, and implementing the dynamic quiz functionality. I also created all the visual elements and ensured the layout was accessible across different screen sizes. This project showcased my ability to combine content, design, and interactivity in a solo development context.</p>
