    <br><h1>Web Application about Historical Revolutions</h1><br>

    <p>This educational web application was developed to teach users about three of the most significant historical revolutions: the French, Russian, and American Revolutions. The goal was to make history more engaging and interactive for students through a digital platform.</p><br>

    <p>The application was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on clean layout, responsiveness, and ease of use. It features historical timelines, summaries of each revolution, and interactive quizzes to test users' knowledge.</p><br>

    <p>My role involved designing the front-end interface, structuring content delivery, and implementing a dynamic quiz feature. I also created visual elements and ensured that the site layout was accessible across different screen sizes and devices. The final product was presented as part of a group showcase to demonstrate our ability to combine design with educational value.</p>
